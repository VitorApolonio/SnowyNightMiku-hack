# Snowy Night Miku KDE splash theme

![splash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/146b4456-f479-4378-b10b-1cff225a1bda)

Not my theme, I'm nowhere near this artistic; all I did was create metadata files so the theme could actually be loaded, as the install script was broken.

I also sped up the animations so they'd look right on computers with quick boot times.

To install, just place the main folder here on `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/` and select it from the KDE splash theme settings.
